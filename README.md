# 3D Printing Showcase

Välkommen till mitt galleri av 3D-printade projekt! Här delar jag bilder på mina utskrifter och ger en kort beskrivning av varje.

## Solderingstation

I did this modell in freeCAD. I was printing out one of the other solderingstation that was on Thingiverse, but the size of the plastic that the solder is on, didn't fitt. So I made my own modell.

The cover of the car heating socket broke. So to prevent dirt from going into the outlet, I created this plug that covers. Made this model in Tinkercad.
